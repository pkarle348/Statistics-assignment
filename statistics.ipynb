        "\n",

This is important for understanding the precision of the inferences made from the sample. Statistical methods can then quantify the uncertainty associated with the sample estimates.\n",

Properly executed random sampling helps ensure that sample-based findings are generalizable to the broader population."

        "# 1.Central Tendency:\n",
        "\n",
        "Skewness affects the relative positions of the mean, median, and mode. In skewed distributions, the mean is pulled toward the direction of the skew (right for positive skew, left for negative skew), while the median remains more resistant to extreme values.\n",
        "\n",
        "In highly skewed data, the median is often a better measure of central tendency than the mean because it is less influenced by outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2.Outliers and Extreme Values:\n",
        "\n",
        "Skewed distributions are often associated with the presence of outliers. In positively skewed data, extreme high values affect the shape, while in negatively skewed data, extreme low values do so.\n",
        "\n",
        "These outliers can significantly impact statistical measures like the mean, variance, and standard deviation, making them less reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3.Data Spread and Interpretation:\n",
        "\n",
        "In skewed distributions, the data is unevenly spread. For example, in a right-skewed distribution, most values are clustered on the left, but the few large values on the right \"stretch\" the scale.\n",
        "This impacts how you interpret variability: in a right-skewed distribution, while the range might appear large, most data points are actually close to the lower end.\n",
        "# 4.Statistical Tests:\n",
        "\n",
        "Many statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) assume that the data is normally distributed (i.e., zero skewness). Skewness may violate this assumption, leading to inaccurate results. In such cases, data transformations (like logarithmic or square root transformations) can be applied to reduce skewness and meet these assumptions.\n",
        "#5.Decision-Making:\n",
        "\n",
        "In business and economics, understanding skewness is crucial. For example, in investment returns, a right-skewed distribution suggests that there are a few extremely high returns but most returns are lower. Conversely, a left-skewed distribution in sales data might suggest that there are many small sales and few large ones.\n",
